name: Day 14 EOD handoff — Transcorp Subscription Planner pilot
description: 4 PRs merged today (#144 Posture B P5 query fix, #145 cron decoupling T3 plan, #146 status-casing T1 fix, #147 tests bootstrap handoff). Materialization handler is feature-complete on `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code` (10 commits, last `72f4735`) — Phases 1-6 + queue routes (push-task + push-task-failed) + `pushTasksForTenant` retirement (-1737 lines net) + bootstrap script. Tests §7.1-§7.4 deferred to fresh Day-15 session per PR #147 handoff. Operations: PR #139 migrations 0014-0019 applied to prod (Track B); migration 0020 NOT yet applied — coupled-deploy with code PR per §4.2 amendment 4. Cron diagnostic: today's manual trigger ran cleanly; FBU "0 tasks tomorrow" was correct cadence (Tue/Fri only), not an incident. Posture B Stage 1 deferred to Day-15 morning ≥06:11 +0400 Dubai (48h soak gate).

# Day 14 EOD Claude Code session handoff — 5 May 2026 (calendar Day 14 ≈ plan Day 16)

**For:** Fresh Claude Code session picking up from Day 14 close

**Read this entire document before responding.**

## §0 Product brief reference (load-bearing)

[`memory/PLANNER_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`](../PLANNER_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md) is at **v1.2** as of PR #141 (merged Day 13 evening). No brief amendments today; subscriptions.status casing correction (PR #146) corrected the **plan**, not the brief — the brief never specified casing for subscriptions.status; the corrected plan now anchors to `0009_subscription.sql:136-137` schema source.

**Demo target unchanged: May 12.** Five days remaining (Day 15 → Day 19).

The brief supersedes `docs/plan.docx` §10 in conflict. Every fresh session reads the brief in full before any action; every substantive PR references brief sections; scope amendments require explicit `decision_*.md` + version bump in §9. If this EOD doc conflicts with the brief, **the brief wins**.

## §1 Repo state at EOD

```
main HEAD:        762a36c  chore(memory): T1 — file Day-14 tests + PR-open bootstrap handoff (#147)
Day-14 starting:  4731553  chore(memory): T1 — file Day 13 EOD handoff (#143)
unit baseline:    ~805 (Day-13 was 808; -3 deleted cron-loop tests on day14 code branch — see §3)
integration:      ~159 (unchanged on main; day14 code branch hasn't merged yet)
typecheck:        clean (verified on day14 code branch + chore branches)
lint:             clean
working tree:     clean (post-EOD-fill on chore/day-14-eod branch)
```

**Production lag:** **15 commits behind production** (was 11 at Day-13 EOD; +4 from today's merges). The plan's 10-commit feature work on `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code` is NOT yet on main — it lands via the code PR opening in Day-15 fresh session per PR #147 handoff. Per `feedback_claude_code_executes_default.md`, Love runs Vercel promote.

**Branches outstanding:**
- `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code` (commit `72f4735`, 10 commits ahead of main) — code feature-complete; awaits tests + PR open
- No other open branches at EOD

## §2 Day-14 PR ledger (chronological)

4 PRs touched today, all 4 merged. Substantive ratio: 1 T3 plan + 3 T1 (operational fixes + handoff doc).

| # | PR | Tier | Scope | Merge HEAD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D14-1 | [#144](https://github.com/lovemansgit/planner/pull/144) | T1 | chore(memory): T1 — fix Posture B runbook §1 P5 query (fail-open semantics) | (squash; pre-`145`) |
| D14-2 | [#145](https://github.com/lovemansgit/planner/pull/145) | T3 | chore(memory): T3 — Day-14 cron materialization↔push decoupling plan | `27c5b8c` |
| D14-3 | [#146](https://github.com/lovemansgit/planner/pull/146) | T1 | chore(memory): T1 — fix Day-14 cron plan §3 status casing (subscriptions.status is lowercase, not uppercase) | `7a07b28` |
| D14-4 | [#147](https://github.com/lovemansgit/planner/pull/147) | T1 | chore(memory): T1 — file Day-14 tests + PR-open bootstrap handoff | `762a36c` |

**Plus this EOD doc** (T1, opens after surfacing).

PR #145 is the headline — 1110-line plan filed across 11 amendment fixups during section-by-section reviewer counter-review, then merged. PR #146 caught a status-casing error in §3 of the plan (uppercase `'ACTIVE'` instead of schema's lowercase `'active'`) during Phase 2 code implementation pre-flight. PR #144 fixed two fail-open query bugs in the Posture B runbook surfaced by the §1 P5 probe execution.

## §3 Substantive code branch state — `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code` (FEATURE-COMPLETE, awaits tests)

10 commits, ~+2,800 / -1,800 net (substantive code surface plus retirements). All typecheck-clean, lint-clean. **Zero new tests in this session — tests are PR #147 handoff's job for Day-15 fresh session.**

| Commit | Scope |
|---|---|
| `de25101` | Phase 1 — reconciliation scan (`listReconciliationCandidatesByTenant` repo function + handler block) |
| `fc172ee` | Phase 2 — bulk INSERT…SELECT with 4-layer COALESCE + §2.2 quarantine counter |
| `0debab1` | Phase 3 — horizon advance via UPDATE on `subscription_materialization` |
| `31ed37b` | Phase 4 — run-row write with §4.4 5-status branching + stale-running CAS recovery (writeRunRowPhase4 + migration 0020) |
| `1af4c05` | Phase 5 — post-commit `batchJSON` enqueue (flowControl + deduplicationId + failureCallback + retries config) |
| `c3eb995` | Phase 6 — handler-exit summary log + return (materialization handler feature-complete) |
| `7694190` | Queue consumer `/api/queue/push-task` per §5.1 (10-value Outcome enum, two-read guards, pushSingleTask invocation) |
| `08e7543` | Queue failureCallback `/api/queue/push-task-failed` per §5.2 amendment 5 |
| `e5b28a0` | `pushTasksForTenant` retirement per §1.3 — net **-1737 lines** (3 cron-loop test files deleted; service.ts trimmed 1145→665) |
| `72f4735` | `scripts/backfill-subscription-materialization.mjs` — one-time bootstrap script |

## §4 Operations executed today

### §4.1 PR #139 migrations 0014-0019 applied to production (Track B)

Per the morning Track B work — all 6 migrations from PR #139 applied via Supabase SQL editor as a single 979-line transactional block. Verified via `to_regclass()` probe post-apply: `subscription_materialization`, `addresses`, `subscription_exceptions`, `consignee_crm_events`, `consignee_timeline_events` (VIEW with `security_invoker=true`), `webhook_events` all present. Smoke-tested by the Day-14 backfill script's dry-run (counts 860 active subs / 0 existing materialization rows).

This satisfies §11.2 row 1 of the merged plan PR #145 (migration 0015 application status confirmed).

### §4.2 Migration 0020 NOT yet applied — coupled-deploy with code PR

Per [merged plan §4.2 amendment 4](../plans/day-14-cron-decoupling.md): migration 0020 (`task_generation_runs.target_date` column + `(tenant_id, target_date)` UNIQUE) MUST land in the same Vercel deploy as the new materialization handler. NOT NULL on `target_date` breaks the legacy `task-generation/service.ts:223` INSERT path. Migration-only deploy without handler swap = production cron breaks at next tick.

**Sequencing per PR #147 handoff §5:**
1. Day-15 fresh session writes §7.1-§7.4 tests on `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code`
2. Code PR opens; Love counter-reviews; merges
3. Migration 0020 applied via Supabase SQL editor (same path as PR #139 migrations today) — Love-action
4. Vercel deploys the new handler
5. Love runs `npm run backfill-subscription-materialization -- --yes=true` against production
6. Next 12:00 UTC cron tick fires the new handler

Migration 0020 file lives in git on `day14/t3-cron-decoupling-code`; CI test DB picks it up via `scripts/setup-test-db.sh:58` glob automatically.

### §4.3 Manual cron trigger — clean run; FBU 0-tasks finding is correct cadence, not an incident

Manual trigger of `/api/cron/generate-tasks` against production today (pre-12:00 UTC scheduled tick; same diagnostic posture as Day-13 morning's cron memo). Outcome:

- All 3 demo tenants ran cleanly
- MPL (meal-plan-scheduler): generated tasks for tomorrow's eligible date
- DNR (dr-nutrition): generated tasks
- FBU (fresh-butchers): **0 tasks for tomorrow** — initially looked anomalous, but verified that FBU's seed data per `scripts/seed-subscriptions-config.mjs` is **Tue/Fri-only cadence**. Tomorrow's calendar date in Dubai is not Tue or Fri, so 0-task generation is the **correct expected outcome**. Not an incident; not an SF integration failure; not a cron handler bug.

This rules out FBU as a flake variable in tomorrow's first-tick-after-handler-cutover diagnostic.

### §4.4 Posture B Stage 1 — deferred to Day-15 morning ≥06:11 +0400 Dubai

Per PR #144 runbook + Day-13 EOD §6.2: 48h soak window from PR #116's Day-10 auth landing (2026-05-04 02:11 UTC = 06:11 +0400 Dubai). Today's pre-flight check via Day-14 morning probe found:

- P1 ✓ PASS — PR #104 auth code on production via PR #116 promote
- P2 ✗ **WAS-FAILING-AT-MORNING** — soak elapsed only 25.9h at probe time; gate clears 2026-05-06 06:11 +0400 Dubai
- P3 ✓ PASS — 14 successful logins in last 60h (real Supabase Auth)
- P4 ✓ PASS — 1 isolated failed login (typo, no auth-broken-for-real-user pattern)
- P5 ✓ PASS (after PR #144 fix) — all 3 demo merchants have ≥1 tenant-admin
- P6 ✓ PASS — `process.env.ALLOW_DEMO_AUTH` runtime gate exists only at request-context.ts + demo-context.ts

**Day-15 morning ≥06:11 Dubai:** P2 gate clears; Love executes Stage 1 (Vercel UI env-var removal). Stage 2 PR drafts post-Stage-1 verification per runbook §6 Q4 default.

## §5 Day-15 plan

Five-day countdown to demo:

### Day 15 (Wednesday May 6, 2026 in plan; calendar may differ slightly)

**Morning blocks (sequential, Love + fresh session interleave):**
1. Posture B Stage 1 fires (Love runs Vercel UI env-var removal at ≥06:11 Dubai)
2. Stage 2 code-cleanup PR drafts (Builder action post-Love-go-ahead per runbook §6 Q4)
3. Fresh Claude Code session opens per PR #147 handoff:
   - Bootstrap context (read brief, read PR #147 handoff doc, read merged plan)
   - Write §7.1 materialization cron tests (~13 row tests)
   - Write §7.2 push handler tests (~12 row tests)
   - Write §7.3 migration 0020 tests (~6 row tests)
   - Write §7.4 happy-path integration test (~10 steps)

**Afternoon blocks:**
4. Code PR opens with §11.2 9-gate checklist as PR body
5. Love counter-reviews against §11.2 (T3 hard-stop #2 — verification-only)
6. Code PR merges
7. Love applies migration 0020 via Supabase SQL editor
8. Vercel deploys new handler (post-deploy completion confirmed)
9. Love runs `npm run backfill-subscription-materialization -- --yes=true`
10. Day-14 part-2 plan PR drafts (service-layer surface — `addSubscriptionException`, `pauseSubscription`, etc.) — sequenced AFTER cron-decoupling lands per merged plan §8.1

**Evening blocks:**
11. Day-15 EOD batched promotion (production catches up to main)
12. Day-15 EOD doc

**§9 A5 demo-dependency cascade:** decoupling delays → part-2 service layer delays → Day-16+ feature work (4-step wizard, consignee detail calendar, subscription detail UI) delays → demo at risk on May 12. Today's progress preserved the 5-day buffer; Day-15 must land cron-decoupling code PR + part-2 plan to keep schedule.

### Day 16-19 (per [brief §6 day-by-day plan](../PLANNER_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md))

- Day 16: Skip workflow UI + subscription detail page + consolidated merchant calendar + L4 label generation
- Day 17: Per-task delivery status timeline + consignee timeline + CRM state UI + address change workflows
- Day 18: Brand pass + polish + demo data prep + `demo-preflight.sh`
- Day 19: Pre-demo verification + dry-runs + slide deck + demo May 12 morning

All Day-16+ feature work is gated on Day-14 part-2 service layer landing per §8.1 sequencing rationale (a) data-flow + (b) behavioral + (c) same-day T3 PR contention.

## §6 Test count delta vs Day-13

| Surface | Day-13 EOD | Day-14 EOD (main) | Day-14 EOD (day14 code branch) | Delta on day14 branch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | 808 | 808 | ~805 | -3 (deleted cron-loop tests; net negative until §7.1-§7.4 land) |
| Integration | ~159 | ~159 | ~159 | 0 (no integration changes; §7.4 lands in fresh session) |
| Typecheck | clean | clean | clean | — |
| Lint | clean | clean | clean | — |

The fresh Day-15 session lands ~26 row tests (§7.1-§7.4 per merged plan §7) plus the §7.5 6-row edge-case integration tests as a deferred follow-up. Net positive count post-tests-merge.

The deleted cron-loop tests (`cron-push-rejects-unknown-district`, `cron-push-rejects-missing-customer-code`, `cron-push-reconciles-awb-exists`) tested the retiring `pushTasksForTenant`. Their per-message-variant equivalents land in §7.2 push-handler tests.
